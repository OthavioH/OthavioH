  # 🧪 Welcome to my test lab
  ## Web Developer 👨‍💻 | 4 years of experience
  ### This is my test lab because when I have a crazy idea I come here, show and test my projects. Sometimes the projects or codes are not productive at all but I obviously try improving it.
  ### I create some projects and solutions mostly in Angular, React and Node using JS/TS but sometimes I try to learn something new like creating a game on Unity Engine. Here I have some abandoned projects and others that sometimes I come to add or fix something but I love creating stuff.

  
  ## 🐱‍💻Below you can find some technologies I used in personal projects or in companies I've worked for:
  - Node.js
  - React

  - AngularJS
