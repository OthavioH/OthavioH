  # 🧪 Welcome to my lab
  #### Here is where I create, test and learn new stuff to improve my knowledge and solve many problems with softwares, and I love doing it.
  
  ## Web Developer 👨‍💻 | 3 years of experience
  
  #### I have 3 years of professional experience and I've been studying programming for 6 years. Studying and creating projects are things that I love to do.
  #### I create some projects and solutions mostly in Angular, React and Node using JS/TS but sometimes I try to learn something new like creating a game on Unity Engine. Here I have all my greatest projects and I love them because I've learned a lot from them and they are simple but significantly incredibles for me.
