  # 🧪 Welcome to my test lab
  #### This is my test lab because when I have a crazy idea I come here and test everything. Sometimes the projects or codes are not productive at all but I obviously try improving it.
  
  ## Web Developer 👨‍💻 | 3 years of experience
  #### I create some projects and solutions mostly in Angular, React and Node using JS/TS but sometimes I try to learn something new like creating a game on Unity Engine. Here I have some abandoned projects and others that sometimes I come to add or fix something but I love creating stuff.
