  # 🧪 Welcome to my lab
  #### This is my laboratory because when I have a crazy idea I come here and create it.
  
  ## Web Developer 👨‍💻 | Almost 3 years of experience
  
  #### I have 2 years and 9 months of professional experience and 6 years of programming knowledge.
  #### I create some projects and solutions mostly in Angular, React and Node using JS/TS but sometimes I try to learn something new like creating a game on Unity Engine. Here I have all my greatest projects (at least some of them are great) and I love creating some stuff.
